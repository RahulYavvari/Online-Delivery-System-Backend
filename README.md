# Online Delivery System Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the Online Delivery System—a robust, multi-vendor online delivery platform. Built with Node.js and TypeScript, the system leverages a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, fault isolation, and ease of maintenance.

> **Design Document:** For detailed design insights, please refer to the attached *Online Delivery Application Backend Design Document*.

---

## Architecture Overview

The backend is organized into several independent microservices, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the system. This modular approach allows for independent scaling, deployment, and maintenance.

## Services

- **Authentication Service**  
  Manages user registration, login, token issuance, and implements role-based access control using JWT.  
  *Key Functions:* Secure user authentication and authorization.

- **API Gateway**  
  Acts as the centralized entry point for all client requests. It routes traffic to the appropriate services, manages load balancing, and enforces security measures such as token validation.  
  *Key Functions:* Request routing, load balancing, and rate limiting.

- **Customer Service**  
  Handles operations related to customer data including profile management, order history tracking, and personalized experience features.  
  *Key Functions:* CRUD operations for customer profiles and support for personalized interactions.

- **Product Service**  
  Manages the product catalog for multiple vendors, including product listings, inventory management, and synchronization with the order service.  
  *Key Functions:* Product management and real-time inventory updates.

- **Order Service**  
  Oversees the complete lifecycle of customer orders—from placement to fulfillment. Integrates with payment, delivery, and review services for seamless order processing.  
  *Key Functions:* Order placement, status tracking, and order analytics.

- **Review Service**  
  Collects and aggregates reviews and ratings for products and vendors, helping to improve transparency and trust in the marketplace.  
  *Key Functions:* Managing and displaying customer reviews and ratings.

- **Payment Service**  
  Ensures secure processing of financial transactions by integrating with external payment gateways. It handles transactions, refunds, and dispute management.  
  *Key Functions:* Secure payment processing and transaction logging.

- **Delivery Service**  
  Coordinates logistics and delivery operations. This service assigns delivery personnel and provides real-time tracking of shipments.  
  *Key Functions:* Delivery agent assignment and live shipment tracking.

- **Notification Service**  
  Sends timely updates to users via email, SMS, and push notifications, keeping them informed about order statuses and promotions.  
  *Key Functions:* Multi-channel communication and alert management.

- **Marketplace Operations Service**  
  Oversees vendor onboarding, product approvals, and overall marketplace analytics to ensure smooth operations and compliance with policies.  
  *Key Functions:* Vendor management and marketplace analytics.

- **Administrator Service**  
  Provides system administrators with tools to monitor performance, manage disputes, and maintain overall system health.  
  *Key Functions:* System monitoring and administrative control.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**  
  Optimizes the delivery of static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript by caching content closer to the user.  
  *Key Functions:* Enhanced static asset delivery and reduced server load.

- **Message Queue**  
  Implements asynchronous communication between services using RabbitMQ, ensuring reliable event processing and decoupled service interactions.  
  *Key Functions:* Efficient inter-service messaging and task queuing.
